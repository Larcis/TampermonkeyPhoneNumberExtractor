# TampermonkeyPhoneNumberExtractor
Since Instagram does not provide an API for DMs it is relatively hard to automate information extraction from DMs. \
In this code I tried to extract phone numbers (it could be anything else, depends on regex defined in the code) from DMs. Instagram does not load all messages because of performance issues, hence I mocked user gecture for loading messages (scroll to top). \
Code runs via Tampermonkey Chrome extension.
